This repository is a collection of practice projects created during my learning journey in web development, especially focusing on frontend development.  
Each project in this repo serves a different purpose, such as:

- Practicing UI design with Figma  
- Creating responsive layouts using TailwindCSS  
- Developing reusable React components  
- Structuring real-world projects with proper deployment  
- Preparing production-ready portfolio projects for job applications or resumes
